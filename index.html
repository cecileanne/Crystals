      Mareep, Slakoth and Snorlax have backpacks that hold a certain number of
      berries that the professor fills to the brim once they're empty. Click on
      them to collect their pouches (and find out how many berries they're
      holding) - because you need to have a certain number of berries in order
      defend your gym successfully. Too few and you'll lose to much power. Too
      many and your opponents might steal the excess! You need to be right on
      target to win.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      You will face another gym after you win or lose, and your pokemon friends
      will get different pouches for your next battle.
